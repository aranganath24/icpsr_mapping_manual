# Practice Exercises

In this section you'll have the opportunity to apply what you learned in the tutorial provided in Section 4, and practice some of your skills. The following three exercises are arrayed in order of increasing difficulty. 

## Practice Exercise 1

Modify the map we made in Section 4 in the following ways:

* Change the color scheme. What rationale informed your choice of this color scheme? 
* Change the legend breaks. Why did you chose the legend breaks that you did? 
* Replace your name with the current name in the "Map Credits" section. 

What spatial patterns do you notice in this map? Are there any patterns of clustering or dispersion that you find interesting? Do you notice anything surprising or unexpected? And, what future research questions might this map suggest? 

## Practice Exercise 2

Use the same dataset we used in Section 4, but this time please make an interactive map of the country-level average of the "Rigidity_Public_Health" variable. 

What spatial patterns do you notice in this map? Are there any patterns of clustering or dispersion that you find interesting? Do you notice anything surprising or unexpected? And, what future research questions might this map suggest? 

## Practice Exercise 3

Refer to the following [dataset](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/121001/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/121001/fcr:versions/V1/Index_IPR_Agriculture.xlsx&type=file), entitled "Worldwide Index of IPRs [Intellectual Property Rights] in Agriculture, 1961-2018", which is archived on ICPSR and authored by Mercedes Campi amd Alessandro Nuvolari.

Download the dataset, and make a map that shows country-level variation in the "Total_Index" variable in the year 2018. 

## Sample Code for Practice Exercises

The sample code in this section assumes you've already loaded all of the packages discussed in the tutorial, and have correctly set your working directory to the directory in which the dataset(s) are located. 

### Sample Code for Exercise 2

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(rgeos)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

The code below results in a dynamic webmap that represents cross-national variation in the scope of countries' public health interventions (as measured by cross-national variation country-level average of the "Rigidity_Public_Health" variable), during the January to October 2020 time frame. The map uses a light orange to dark red color scheme in which lighter shades of orange represent low values of the index, and progressively darker shades of orange and red represent higher values of the index. Oceans in the dynamic map are represented with the color gray (a lighter shade of gray than what is used for countries without data), and the legend is located on the top-right of the map (above and to the right of Russia). The plus/minus buttons located on the top-left of the map can be used to zoom in and out of the map.

# Brings spatial dataset of country boundaries into R environment using the rnaturalearth package and assigns it to object named "country_boundaries"

                                            summarize(mean_public_health=mean(Rigidity_Public_Health, na.rm=TRUE))

# Join dataset with country-level means for "Rigidity_Public_Health" index ("covid_data_PH_avg" ) to spatial dataset of world boundaries ("country_boundaries"), based on common 3-Digit ISO Codes; then relocate "name" and "mean_economic" fields to the beginning of the dataset so that they're displayed on the map
worldmap_covid_data_PH<-full_join(country_boundaries, covid_data_PH_avg, by=c("iso_a3"="iso")) %>% 
                                  relocate(name, mean_public_health)

# Make map and assign to new object called "covid_PH_webmap"
covid_PH_webmap<-tm_shape(worldmap_covid_data_PH)+
                  tm_polygons(col="mean_public_health", n=5, style="jenks", palette="Oranges")

# Set tmap mode to "view"
tmap_mode("view")

# display map object in view mode
covid_PH_webmap

### Sample Code for Exercise 3

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=c(-1,-2), fig.alt="Choropleth world map showing cross-national variation in IPR index in 2018; light to dark-blue color scheme with lighter shades of blue representing lower values of the index and darker shades of blue representing higher values; countries without data are filled in with gray The map legend is a vertical bar that displays values using discrete color categories with 6 break points and intervals defined by the Jenks algorithm. The legend is displayed on the bottom-left of the map below and to the left of South America. There is no map frame surrounding the map. The legend is titled 'Agriculture IPR Index, 2018', and this title is placed over the vertical legend bar. The map's main title is 'Strength of Intellectual Property Protection in Agriculture, 2018', and is displayed in one line at the top of the map above the northern-most countries. The map map credits are split across four lines, and printed on the bottom-right of the map below Australia and New Zealand."}
